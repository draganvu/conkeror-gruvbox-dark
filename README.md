## Conkeror - Gruvbox-dark-soft theme

This is just a personal attempt to recreate the Gruvbox theme
for Conkeror Web browser. I use the Gruvbox Dark theme with soft
contrast everywhere so I decided to make this theme as there
are not many themes available for Conkeror.

This is a work in progress. I do not use Tabs so that feature 
is not supported. I have just themed the minibuffer and modeline.

## Gruvbox
This [theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) was orginally 
created for Vim by [Pavel Pertsev](https://github.com/morhetz).

## Acknowledgments
There used to be a blackened theme available with Conkeror. 
This is no longer the case but it can still be found 
[here](http://repo.or.cz/conkeror.git/tree/a38b3a3630ebf85a403207b37220cee9790d3a82:/style/blackened).
